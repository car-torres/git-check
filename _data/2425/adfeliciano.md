## About Me
> Hola! I'm Ashley Denise Feliciano. I go by Ash for most people, while close friends and family call me Tuesday. I mostly live in Tigbauan when I don't have a job to do in school, otherwise I stay at my place at the city. Outside of being a Computer Science student, I'm a News Editor for Forum-Dimensions, the official student publication of the University for two years now. Moreover, I'm also the chairperson of the Sangguniang Kabataan Council of our barangay. My most proudest work so far is giving birth to my two canine offspring Ramboorat B. Feliciano and Negatron B. Feliciano. 

> If I have the time, I like to watch movies and listen to music and if I don't, I just mostly lay down and scroll through my social media apps. I also like to tell myself and other people that I'm an avid reader. Some of my favorite books are A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini and The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith. 

> My mantra in life is that I can do great things through spite and delusion which strengthen me.
