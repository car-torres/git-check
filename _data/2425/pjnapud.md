About_Me

>  Hi! I'm Patrick or you can call me _*Pat*_!.

>  My main interest is _*music*_. Why? It's because of the connection I got into it when I was a kid. After Michael Jackson's death wayback 2009, my mom told me to sing his iconic song "Ben". She noticed that I am gifted in music because I can sing in tune and can reach high notes. (Note: That was a decade ago, I don't know what happened.) She pushed me to improve and through the years, I also learned how to play instruments like the guitar and eventually learned how to sort of read musical sheets. I am now in a choir group in Miagao and I still do my passion up to this day. Other interests of mine include _*gaming*_, _*anime*_, and I recently started _*fitness*_.

1. What is your level of expertice for Python Programming?
    > My current level of expertive for Python Programming is a beginner. I already used Python in our past subjects but I didn't focus on it. I somehow understand the basics but I think I need a refresher in order for me to be efficient with it again.
1. Have you developed apps related to machine learning before?
    > I have developed apps together with my classmates but I think it is solely for web applications and web development. I have no prior experience in developing machine learning apps.
1. What are your expectations for this class.
   > My expectations for this class is that it will pave us to be efficient not only in web-based development but also in complex machine learning-based applications. I know that this class will be challenging since I have trouble in my previous machine learning classes but I believe that I can handle the pressure and challenge.
1. Any questions about the course?
   > I have none as of the moment.
