about_me
>  Hi, my name is Pauline Joy Bautista. If you ask me to describe myself, chances are I'll stare into the void because, honestly, I don’t always know the answer. Questions like “tell me about yourself” make my brain short-circuit. But I find watching movies and series, as well as listening to music, helpful in getting to know myself better. With that, I’d say AKMU and Mitski have no-skip discographies filled with meaningful songs. As for movies and series, I tend to enjoy ones that feel closer to reality. Our Blues was a good watch for me, especially because I am familiar with the coastal setting. However, I also appreciate thought-provoking stories like some episodes of House M.D. that left a lasting impression on me.
