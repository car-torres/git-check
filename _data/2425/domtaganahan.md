## Q&A  

### 1️⃣ What’s your level of expertise in Python?  
I'm an **advanced beginner**. I have experience and can apply situational rules, but I still ask "how" when tackling problems. I can set goals, but making them realistic is something I’m still improving.  

### 2️⃣ Have you developed apps related to machine learning before?  
Yes, but I still need to look up the web. I’ll be honest—I struggle with math a lot, but I understand its importance in this subject and am working on improving. 

### 3️⃣ What are your expectations for this class?  
I want to move from being an advanced beginner to competent by gaining more experience, learning to prioritize tasks, and improving my decision-making and responsibility in my work.

### 4️⃣ Any questions about the course?  
Do you have a secret formula for staying sane while guiding multiple thesis projects, or do you just wing it like the rest of us? 😄
