# About Me 👋🏻

> Hi, I’m Gem Win Cañete, but you can call me "Gwen." I have a love-hate relationship with creativity—it sucks the soul out of me (seriously), yet I always find myself chasing more inspiration. Whether it’s through listening to music, scribbling ideas on paper, reading scripts, daydreaming, traveling, or exploring every nook and cranny of creativity, I can’t seem to get enough.  But as much as I love being creative, I also thrive on logic. That’s why I’m here right now. It lets me flex different skill sets and stay fluid—well, mostly when it comes to scheduling! 🤪

>I’m sorry, I was telling you the truth. Do you want me to lie?  
>No, I just wish... I wish that you liked me.  
>Of course I love you.  
>But do you like me?  
>*(faltering)* ...I want you to be the very best version of yourself you can be.  
>What if this is the best version?
