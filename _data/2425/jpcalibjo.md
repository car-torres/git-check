about_me
>  Hey everyone, my name is Joshua Prinze C. Calibjo, I'm your local writer, gamer, programmer, occassional pixel artist, music lover and general tech enthusiast with a lot of crazy ideas that tend to go nowhere.
>
> **Writing**: Yeah I love writing lots of stuff, mostly fanfiction, but also my own original things. In fact I'm actually contributing my writings for a Game Mod (On Sabbatical at the moment though). You'll have to find my postings on your own though, I'm not linking that XD
>
> **Music:** I love music, it makes me feel alive and gives me a lot of inspiration
> 
> **Pixel Artist:** Ehhh, Kinda-sorta, it's a very niche kind of pixel art that focuses on ships, aircraft, and other miscellaneous ideas. It's called shipbucket, go check them out if you're a sucker for warships or planes.
