# Questions and Answer:
1. What is your level of expertise for Python Programming?
    > Worked with a lot of side projects before (did not really finish), also halfway in online courses about python. I'd say I can code well but not that fast and advanced.

2. Have you developed apps related to machine learning before?
    > To be honest, I have not. Although we developed or enhanced a system back in out previous subjects.

3. What are your expectations for this class?
    > Lately, I have been pretty engrossed in the App Development side. Also, using python integrated in the app would be a new experience since I used Flutter in developing apps before.
      It would be a huge help in our Thesis since it is pretty much the same concept we have.

4. Any questions about the course?
    > Right now, I dont have any, But I hope in the future I can ask some questions to help me sharpen my skills here.
