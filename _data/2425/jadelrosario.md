about_me
>  Hey there, I'm Jed. I'm in love with anything **sci-fi**. I'm especially into Warhammer 40000, Dune, Cyberpunk and the like. I really love it when fictional universes feel alive with their own systems and laws. I guess I love being fascinated by well crafted worlds rich with stories. My favorite medium for experiencing these stories are video games. Quite obvious, I know. However, believe this is where my interests in computers originated because now, it is one of my desires to one day take part in the process of creating these worlds for stories to flourish.
